0x04. UTF-8 Validation
Overview
This project focuses on validating UTF-8 encoded data using Python. You'll apply bitwise operations, understand the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and utilize Python programming skills to determine whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Concepts Needed
1. Bitwise Operations in Python
Understanding bitwise manipulation is crucial for this project. You will need to perform operations such as AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), and shifts (<<, >>) to handle and validate the bits of each byte in the dataset.

Resources:
Python Bitwise Operators
2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding system that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. Knowing how characters are encoded in one or more bytes is essential for this task.

3. Data Representation
Understanding how to represent and manipulate data at the byte level is crucial for this project. You'll work with the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate and validate byte data.

4. List Manipulation in Python
You'll need to iterate through lists, access list elements, and use list comprehensions to efficiently process and validate the dataset.

Resources:
Python Lists
5. Boolean Logic
Applying logical operations to make decisions within your program is necessary for correctly validating UTF-8 encoded data.

Requirements
General
Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs.
Environment: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
Coding Standards: Your code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines (version 1.7.x).
Executable Files: Ensure that all your files are executable.
Specific Requirements
Shebang: The first line of all your Python files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3.
Newline: All files should end with a new line.
README.md: A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
Additional Resources
Mock Technical Interview: Take advantage of mock interviews to better prepare for technical assessments related to this project.
By mastering the concepts outlined above and leveraging the provided resources, you'll be well-prepared to implement a solution that accurately validates UTF-8 encoded data.
