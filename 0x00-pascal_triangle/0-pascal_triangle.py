### Python Algorithms

To successfully complete this project, you should be familiar with the following Python concepts:

1. **Lists and List Comprehensions:**
   - Create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.
   - Use list comprehensions to generate rows of Pascal’s Triangle.

2. **Functions:**
   - Define and call functions.
   - Pass parameters and return values, especially a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.

3. **Loops:**
   - Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences.
   - Implement nested loops to generate rows and calculate values in Pascal’s Triangle.

4. **Conditional Statements:**
   - Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions to handle logic, such as setting edges of the triangle to 1.

5. **Recursion (Optional):**
   - Understand recursion for an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.
   - Recognize base cases and recursive cases.

6. **Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Perform addition to compute each element of the triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

7. **Indexing and Slicing:**
   - Access elements and slices of lists for constructing rows.

8. **Memory Management:**
   - Manage list storage and copying effectively, especially when creating new rows.

9. **Error and Exception Handling (Optional):**
   - Use `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors, such as invalid input.

10. **Efficiency and Optimization:**
    - Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve performance, considering time and space complexity.
