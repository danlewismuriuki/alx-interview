Prime Numbers Game - README
Project Overview
This project involves building an algorithm to determine the winner of a competitive game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers. The game requires an understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and efficient algorithms. The challenge is to implement a solution that effectively utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes, prime number identification, and dynamic programming to optimize game strategy and determine the winner.

Concepts Needed
Prime Numbers
Prime Numbers: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
Efficient Algorithms: To solve the problem efficiently, you need to identify prime numbers in a given range using optimized algorithms.
Sieve of Eratosthenes
Sieve of Eratosthenes: A highly efficient algorithm to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
Time Complexity: O(n log log n)
Useful for precomputing prime numbers and their multiples, which are vital for the game.
Game Theory
Game Theory Basics: The game is turn-based, with two players removing prime numbers and their multiples. The goal is to analyze the optimal strategy for each player.
Win Conditions: Understanding strategies that lead to either a win or loss, including identifying losing positions for one player and using that to strategize.
Dynamic Programming/Memoization
Dynamic Programming: To avoid recalculating results for multiple rounds or recursive game scenarios, we can use memoization to store previous results and make the computation faster.
Game Rules
Players take turns removing a prime number and its multiples from a set of consecutive integers.
The game starts with all integers from 2 to n, where n is the upper limit of the range.
Each player on their turn must pick a prime number from the remaining set and remove it along with all its multiples.
The player who cannot make a move (because there are no primes left to remove) loses.
Problem-Solving Strategy
Step 1: Identify Prime Numbers
Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to identify prime numbers in the range from 2 to n. This will give you the set of numbers the players can interact with.
Step 2: Implement Game Logic
Design a game where each player strategically removes primes and their multiples. The turn-based structure and optimal play must be incorporated into the algorithm.
Step 3: Optimal Strategy via Game Theory
Implement game theory to model optimal strategies. Use techniques like minimax or dynamic programming to identify winning and losing positions based on the available prime numbers.
Step 4: Dynamic Programming for Optimization
To avoid recalculating the state of the game at every move, use memoization to store the outcomes of different game states, reducing the time complexity for multiple rounds of play.

Player 1's turn: 2 is removed along with its multiples.
Player 2's turn: 3 is removed along with its multiples.
...
Winner: Player 1
How It Works
The program first generates all prime numbers up to the given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
The game proceeds turn-by-turn, with players removing prime numbers and their multiples.
The game uses dynamic programming to determine the optimal strategy, and the winner is decided based on optimal moves.
Future Improvements
Extend the game to support multiplayer mode.
Explore more complex game strategies using advanced game theory techniques.
Add a graphical user interface for better user interaction.
Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to the concepts of prime number identification, game theory, and dynamic programming. It showcases how these can be combined to solve a competitive game scenario efficiently.
