# Coin Change Problem

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to solve the classic **Coin Change Problem**, which involves finding the minimum number of coins required to make up a given amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project serves as an exercise in **Dynamic Programming (DP)** and **Greedy Algorithms**, focusing on both correctness and efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Given a list of coin denominations and a target amount, the goal is to determine the fewest number of coins needed to make up the total amount. If it's not possible to achieve the target amount with the given coins, the solution should return -1.

### Example
```text
Input: coins = [1, 2, 5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 can be made with three coins: 5 + 5 + 1
