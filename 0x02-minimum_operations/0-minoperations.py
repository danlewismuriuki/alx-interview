Minimum Operations to Achieve n Characters
This project contains a method to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve exactly n 'H' characters in a text file using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste".

Problem Description
In a text file, you start with a single character 'H'. You can perform two operations:

Copy All: Copies all characters currently in the file to the clipboard.
Paste: Pastes the contents of the clipboard into the file.
Given a number n, the goal is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file. If it is impossible to achieve n characters, the method should return 0.

Example
For n = 9, the operations would be:

Start with H
Copy All
Paste → HH
Paste → HHH
Copy All
Paste → HHHHHH
Paste → HHHHHHHHH
Total operations: 6

Solution
The method minOperations(n) calculates the minimum number of operations required. It works by evaluating the factors of n and using them to determine the sequence of operations.

Usage
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview.git
Navigate to the Directory

bash
Copy code
cd 0x02-minimum_operations
Run the Test Script

Make sure to have Python 3 installed. You can run the test script as follows:

bash
Copy code
./0-main.py
The script will print the minimum number of operations required for different values of n.

File Structure
0-minoperations.py: Contains the implementation of the minOperations(n) method.
0-main.py: Test script for checking the functionality of the minOperations method.
Method Definition
